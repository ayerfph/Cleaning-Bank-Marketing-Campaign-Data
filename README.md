# About this Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`notebook.ipynb`) where I explore and practice various concepts in Python programming and data analysis.  
It serves as a hands-on project to improve my skills in writing clean code, analyzing data, and experimenting with different libraries.

## What I'm Learning
- How to use **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive coding and documentation.
- Fundamental **Python** programming concepts (variables, loops, functions, etc.).
- **Data analysis** techniques using libraries like `pandas` and `numpy`.
- Organizing code and markdown cells for clear and readable notebooks.
